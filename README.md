# Modeling Taiwan Air Quality Index (AQI) using Simple Linear Regression

## About Me

## Project Overview
This project examines the correlation between the Air Quality Index (AQI) and different pollutant concentrations in Taiwan. Utilizing a dataset of 280 observations, I determined PM2.5 to be the main factor affecting air quality and developed a Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model to forecast AQI levels

## Key Findings
* **Strongest Predictor:** PM2.5 showed a Pearson correlation of 0.85 with AQI.
* **Model Performance:** The SLR model achieved an R² of 0.72, explaining 72% of the variance in AQI.
* **Statistical Significance:** A hypothesis test confirmed a statistically significant association (p-value < 0.05).

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** R
* **Methods:** Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Correlation Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Residual Diagnostics.
